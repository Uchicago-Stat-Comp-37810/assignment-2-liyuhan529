# # Study Drill

# 1.Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.  
# 2.Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python3.6 this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.  
# 3.Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.  
# 4.Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

#1. See the comments above
#2. done
#3. Put the following command in a seperate file, and it will work.
print((4+5)-5*3)
#4. Just rewrite all integers with an extra .0. For instance rewrite 3 as 3.0.
